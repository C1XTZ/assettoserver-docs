# Introduction

## About
AssettoServer is a custom game server for Assetto Corsa developed with freeroam in mind. It greatly improves upon the default game server by fixing various security issues and providing new features like AI traffic and dynamic weather.

Race/Quali sessions and lap times are not supported yet. Only use this if you want to run a practice-only freeroam server.

This is a fork of https://github.com/Niewiarowski/AssettoServer.

## Installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

  * Install the [ASP.NET 6 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) (select "Hosting Bundle")
  * Download `assetto-server-win-x64.zip` from the [latest stable release](https://github.com/compujuckel/AssettoServer/releases/latest) and extract it wherever you want.  

  :::caution DO NOT EXTRACT TO YOUR ASSETTO CORSA FOLDER!

    AC and AssettoServer use different versions of the Steam SDK that will conflict with each other.
    If you still feel the need to extract to your AC folder delete the steam_api64.dll from the server first, but this will cause Steam Auth to be broken.

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

  * Follow the [ASP.NET 6 Runtime installation instructions for your distro](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux)
  * Download `assetto-server-linux-x64.tar.gz` from the [latest stable release](https://github.com/compujuckel/AssettoServer/releases/latest) and extract it wherever you want.

## Usage

### Through Content Manager (full)

* Open your AC server folder in Explorer, e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\server`
* Rename `acServer.exe` to something else
* Extract `assetto-server-win-x64.zip` into this directory
* Rename `AssettoServer.exe` to `acServer.exe`

Now you can run servers through CM just like you would with the original server. Keep in mind that not all features of the original server are supported yet, so some of the server settings in CM will either have no effect or the features will just not work.

### Dedicated server

The easiest way to get started is creating your server configuration with Content Manager.  
After that just click "Pack" to create an archive with all required configs and data files. Extract this archive into the server root folder.

## Features

Most features can be controlled via `extra_cfg.yml`. If this file does not exist it will be created at first server startup.

### Steam Authentication

The default server implementation of Assetto Corsa does not use the Steam API to determine whether a connected player
is actually the account they claim to be. This opens the door for SteamID spoofing, which means someone can
impersonate another player.

In this server the [Steam Auth API](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/auth) is utilized, which makes SteamID spoofing impossible.

Since the player needs to get a Steam session ticket before joining, a CSP (Custom Shaders Patch) version of 0.1.75 or higher and Content Manager v0.8.2297.38573 or higher is required.

This feature must be enabled in `extra_cfg.yml`.

### Logging in as administrator via SteamID

To automatically login as admin enter your SteamID in `admins.txt` in the server folder.

:::caution

Do not use this feature with Steam Auth disabled! Someone might be able to gain admin rights with SteamID spoofing.

### AI Traffic

It is possible to load one or more AI splines to provide AI traffic. Place `fast_lane.ai` (or `fast_lane.aip`) in the maps `ai/` folder and set `EnableAi` to `true` in `extra_cfg.yml`.  
The default AI settings have been tuned for Shutoko Revival Project, other maps may require different settings.

To allow AI to take a car slot you have to add a new parameter to the `entry_list.ini`, for example:
```ini
[CAR_0]
MODEL=ktyu_c8_lav_s1
SKIN=04_gunmetal_grey/ADAn
BALLAST=0
RESTRICTOR=0
// highlight-next-line
AI=auto
```

Possible values for the `AI` parameter are
* `auto` - AI will take the slot when it is empty
* `fixed` - AI will always take the car slot. It won't be possible for players to join in this slot
* `none` - AI will never take the slot (default)

When using `AI=auto` slots it is highly recommended to specify a `MaxPlayerCount` in `extra_cfg.yml` to make sure there is always a minimum amount of AI cars available.

:::note

Admins can always join on AI slots.

### Dynamic Weather

The server supports CSPs WeatherFX v1 which allows dynamic weather, smooth weather transitions and RainFX. CSP 0.1.76+ is required for this feature.

Three plugins are included that utilize dynamic weather:
* [LiveWeatherPlugin](./plugins/LiveWeatherPlugin.md) for getting realtime weather from openweathermap.org
* [RandomWeatherPlugin](./plugins/RandomWeatherPlugin.md) for random weather
* [VotingWeatherPlugin](./plugins/VotingWeatherPlugin.md) for letting players vote for weather changes

### Plugin Interface

There is an experimental plugin interface for adding functionality to the server. Take a look at the [sample plugin](./plugins/SamplePlugin.md) to get started with developing your own plugin.

The API is still under development and might change in the future.
